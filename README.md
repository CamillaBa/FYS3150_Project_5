# FYS3150_Project_5

This repository contains 11 header files,
1 cpp file and 1 python file. The header files are:

* vector.h                          (A vector class made for simple 1-dim arrays)
* matrix.h                          (A matrix class made for simple 2-dim arrays)
* print_vector_matrix.h             (File containind various print functions)
* tridiag_solver.h                  (Solves a special tridiag matrix eq)

* one_dim_diffusion_eq.h            (A class to represent a spacial solution at a given time)
* one_dim_diffusion_eq_heat_prod.h  (Similar, but with functional heat prod argument)
* two_dim_diffusion_eq.h            (A class to represent a spacial solution at a given time)
* two_dim_diffusion_eq_heat_prod.h  (Similar, but with functional heat prod argument)

* physics.h                         (Various functions for the refertilization problem)
* unit_tests.h                      (Various unit tests)

Then there are "Header.h" and "Main.cpp". 
The file "Header.h" simply includes all of the above header files. 
"Header.h" is imported to "Main.cpp".
In "Main.cpp", you will find code to generate the data used for plotting.
The plots can be generated by "plots.py".
